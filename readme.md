Chrome extension text-to-speech based on selected text.

Don't miss-spelled anymore

Very fun simple stuff, took me about 10 minutes to code this.

- Download or clone
- Enable Developer Mode on Chrome
- Pack his repo
- Intall it by dragging to chrome://extension
- Add this app id to Whitelist in Chrome policy

It's just a prototype, will update anytime soon and lanch on webstore.

Fireworks or another browser? Yea, maybe.

Allright, sign out!
