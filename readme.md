Chrome extension text-to-speech based on selected text.

Don't miss-spelled anymore.

Very fun simple stuff, took me about 10 minutes to code this.

- Download or clone.
- Enable Developer Mode on Chrome.
- Pack this repo.
- Install it by dragging to chrome://extension.
- Add this extension id to whitelist in Chrome policy (Windows User).

It's just a prototype, will update anytime soon and launch on webstore.

Firefox or another browser? Yea, maybe.

Alright, sign out!
